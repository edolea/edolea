## 🚀 Projects & Highlights

- **[GraphDL-Postprocess-USI-Project](https://github.com/edolea/GraphDL-Postprocess-USI-Project)**  
  Spatiotemporal GNNs for **wind-speed forecasting** on the MeteoSwiss dataset.  
  Builds a station graph, compares temporal models (RNN / temporal conv + message passing), and tracks experiments via Hydra + MLflow.  

- **[Team3_EUMASTER4HPC2526](https://github.com/edolea/Team3_EUMASTER4HPC2526)**  
  Toolkit to **deploy & benchmark vLLM stacks on MeluXina (Slurm)**.  
  Includes server/client/monitor modules, Prometheus metrics, and JSON reports to study throughput vs cost.  

- **[Graph_Coloring](https://github.com/edolea/Graph_Coloring)**  
  Parallel **MPI solver** for the graph-coloring challenge.  
  Cluster-ready build (CMake + job.slurm) and analysis of scalability and runtime behavior.  

- **ONN-Based Chromatic-Dispersion Pre-Compensation (MATLAB)**  
  MATLAB simulation of **optical neural networks** for chromatic-dispersion pre-compensation in fiber links.  
  Visualizes signal evolution and explores model parameters in photonic computing.  

- **Java 2D Game (Capstone)**  
  A small team-built game written in **Java**, showcasing object-oriented design, unit testing, and CI basics.
